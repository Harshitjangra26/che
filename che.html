            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Solid waste management has become a critical global issue due to rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and population expansion. The term "solid waste" refers to various forms of refuse, ranging from household garbage and industrial by-products to hazardous waste and medical discards. As societies grow and consumption increases, the volume of solid waste produced continues to rise, creating mounting pressure on the environment, infrastructure, and health systems worldwide. According to the World Bank, global waste generation is expected to increase by 70% by 2050 if current practices remain unchanged.<br><br>

                The improper disposal and accumulation of solid waste pose severe environmental hazards. Land pollution, air contamination through the release of toxic gases, and water pollution due to landfill leachate are common environmental impacts. Additionally, improper waste management contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily methane, which exacerbates climate change. Furthermore, unmanaged waste can lead to the proliferation of disease vectors, threatening public health in many regions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
                <br><br>
                Globally, solid waste disposal methods vary by region and economic development. Traditional methods include landfilling, incineration, open dumping, and composting. Landfills remain the most common method in many countries, although they present challenges such as land use limitations and methane emissions. Incineration, while reducing waste volume, can release harmful emissions if not properly regulated. Recycling and composting are growing trends, especially in more economically advanced regions, as they reduce the volume of waste sent to landfills and promote resource recovery.
                <br><br>
                However, these conventional methods are no longer sustainable on their own. The increasing emphasis on sustainability has led to the exploration of integrated waste management solutions. Circular economy principles, which prioritize reducing, reusing, and recycling materials, are gaining traction as long-term strategies to minimize waste and its environmental impacts. Technologies such as waste-to-energy plants and bioreactors are also being considered as alternatives that provide energy recovery and minimize landfill use.
                <br><br>
                 The global status of solid waste management reflects both the challenges and the evolving solutions in addressing this environmental issue. To mitigate the impacts on the environment, sustainable disposal methods must be prioritized alongside innovative approaches that focus on waste minimization, resource recovery, and energy efficiency. Addressing solid waste in a sustainable manner is essential for both environmental protection and the advancement of human health and well-being.
